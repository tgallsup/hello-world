# hello-world
Infrastructure guy learning something new.

Saw some code (HTML and Java and VB6) back in college and said "nope, not for me" so I stayed with infrastructure.
I got into security, which was great, then decided to be the best corporate citizen I could and learned/did what my company needed me for the most.

I was swiftly moved into Server Administration and System design... then agreed to become a PM.  After PM work for several years, my company asked me to join the ranks of the management/leadership folks.

I've been there ever since, and as fun as it has been, it's time to learn something new.
